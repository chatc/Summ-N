# Summ-N
Source code for [SUMM^N: A Multi-Stage Summarization Framework for Long InputDialogues and Documents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10150.pdf)

Since I joined PSU NLP Lab last semester, this repo has been moved to https://github.com/psunlpgroup/Summ-N. 

Although the new repo is still under construction, e.g. I am doing refactor of query based summarization, one can find some implementation details if needed ðŸ˜€

Thanks a lot for visiting the repo!
